# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains selected projects completed as part of Princeton University's
Algorithms and Data Structures course. The focus of this repository is on algorithm
implementation and data structure design.

Each project includes only files that I contributed to. Course-provided starter code, libraries,
test inputs, and autograder files are intentionally excluded.

## Notes
These projects were completed as coursework. Problem statements and full assignment
specifications are available on the course website:
