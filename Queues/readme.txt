Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why?
 **************************************************************************** */

I used a linked list for deque because I only needed to work with the front
and the back without any interruptions in the middle.

I used resizing array for radomized queue because I had to work with elements
in the middle of the list which would be really hard to do with linked list.
